          </div>

          <div>
            <a href="http://jumpgame.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Jump!</a> is an educational game designed to aid migrant workers in Qatar
            in learning English.
          </div>

          <div>
            I worked on Jump! as part of a team of 4 and this was a project
            for the class 15-239 Programming for Social Good in Spring 2014.
            We worked in collaboration with Reach Out To Asia (ROTA) and the game was designed to
            meet the specific needs of the students in their Adult English Literacy program (RAEL).
          </div>

          <div>
            My contribution to the game was designing and implementing part of the game mechanics, and working on the integration
            of questions into the game. I also fixed various minor bugs that were uncovered during user testing.
          </div>

          <div>
            The project is live at <a href="http://jumpgame.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">jumpgame.herokuapp.com</a>.

          <div>
            <a href="http://www.schedulecmu.org" target="_blank">ScheduleCMU</a> is a schedule planning app designed for Carnegie Mellon
            students to plan their course schedule from the convenience of their
            computer or their smartphone.
          </div>

          <div>
            I worked on ScheduleCMU as part of a team of 4 and this was our final project
            for the class 15-237 Cross Platform Mobile Web Apps in Fall 2012. I mainly worked on the
            back end of the project which involved a node.js server and a MongoDB database. I was also responsible
            for designing and implementing the APIs that were used for communication of information
            (class information and user schedules) between the back end and the front end of the project.
          </div>

          <div>
            The project is live at <a href="http://www.schedulecmu.org" target="_blank">www.schedulecmu.org</a>.

            <h3>Colors</h3>
          </div>

          <div>
            <a href="http://colorsapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Colors</a> is a browser game that is based on the idea of graph coloring.
            I worked with <a href="http://www.isaacl.net" target="_blank">Isaac Lim</a> and
            <a href="http://www.raemadeline.com" target="_blank">Madeline Horowitz</a> to make it
            during the PennApps hackathon in Fall 2013.
          </div>

          <div>
            Players color the graph such that no two dots connected by a line have
            the same color. Graphs are randomly generated and an extra node is added
            upon advancing each level, making the levels increasingly complex. Each
            level has a time limit of 30 seconds.
          </div>

          <div>
            Scoring is based on the level number as well as on the number of colors
            used in the coloring (lesser colors mean more points)
          </div>

          <div>
            Do play it at <a href="http://colorsapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">colorsapp.herokuapp.com</a>.
            I should warn you that it's highly addictive!
            You can also see our code on <a href="https://github.com/niveditc/Colors" target="_blank">Github</a>.

          <div>
            <a href="https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~awdavis/jphotobooth/" target="_blank">JPhotoBooth</a>
            is a JavaScript based webcam tool.
            It allows you to draw on your video feed and save snapshots of your drawing.
            You can also upload the resulting pictures to Imgur and Facebook.
          </div>

          <div>
            I worked on this with Tom Zhang and Austin Davis as a class project.
            We built the tool using the getUserMedia API, jQuery and Sketch,js.
            Flash is not required to use this tool.
          </div>
