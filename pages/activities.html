            I was responsible for assisting the Copy Manager of the newspaper,
            and making decisions on layout or content in his absence. My
            responsibilities included reading through pages of the
            newspaper to ensure that articles preserve integrity of content and
            conform to the established style of The Tartan.
            As part of this, I scanned for spelling and grammatical
            errors, fixed layout, and ensured that
            names were spelt right and sources were cited correctly.

              Undergraduate Sisters Program</a></b>

            I was co-chair for this program. Here's what I did in this capacity:
          </div>
          <div>
            I helped manage the matching process for Big/Little Sisters, where
            freshmen women are assigned an upperclass mentor whom they can
            easily approach.
          </div>
          <div>
            I organized various social events both on and off campus where
            undergraduate women in computer science can join in to do a fun
            activity while getting to know other women studying computer science.
          </div>
          <div>
            In Spring 2014, I also proposed a social event called Class Mixers
            for the women of each class to meet each other and do a fun activity
            together. I helped organize the Class Mixer for the women of the
            Class of 2015, which was very well-received.

            In my junior year, I was co-leader of the team that manages the

          <div>
          Updating the content of the website to reflect the ongoing activities
            of the organization
          </div>

          <div>
            Redesigning various parts of the website using modern technologies,
            while ensuring support for older content dating as far back as
            1999. In Spring 2014, I did an independent study to research
            technologies that were best suited to our specific purpose.
