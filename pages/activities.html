            is Carnegie Mellon's organization to support and promote
            women in Computer Science. The organization is involved in
            organizing mentorship for and promoting a sense of community among
            undergraduate and graduate women in Computer Science as well as
            in Computer Science outreach to various schools in the area.

          </div>
          <div>
            I'm a co-chair for this program. Here's what I do in this capacity:
          </div>
          <div>
            I help manage the matching process for Big/Little Sisters, where
            freshmen women are assigned an upperclass mentor whom they can
            easily approach.
            As part of this, in Fall 2013, I have improved the process, so that
            everyone involved submits preferences which we compile into a cheat
            sheet. Then we hold an event where, with the aid of the cheat sheet,
            prospective big and little sisters can approach each other and
            conduct a meaningful conversation. We then take rankings and
            preferences from everyone involved and analyze them to make
            the matchings
          </div>
          <div>
            I organize various social events both on and off campus where
            undergrad women can join in to do a fun activity while munching
            goodies and chatting with others
          </div>
          <div>
            In Spring 2014, I also proposed a social event called Class Mixers
            for the women of each class to meet each other and do a fun activity
            together. I helped organize the Class Mixer for the women of the
            Class of 2015, which was very well-received.

          <div>
            In my junior year, I was co-leader of the team that manages the

          Updating the content of the website to reflect the ongoing activities

          </div>

          <div>
            Redesigning various parts of the website using modern technologies,
            while ensuring support for older content dating as far back as
            1999. In Spring 2014, I did an independent study to research what
            technologies are best suited to our purpose.

            I'm responsible for assisting the Copy Manager of the newspaper,

            preserve integrity of content and conform to our established

            errors, fix layout as well as ensure that
