          <a href="http://www.women.cs.cmu.edu">Women@SCS</a> is Carnegie Mellon's organization to support and promote
          women in Computer Science. The organization is involved in
          organizing mentorship for and promoting a sense of community among
          undergraduate and graduate women in Computer Science as well as
          in Computer Science outreach to various schools in the area

              Undergraduate Sisters Program</a></b><br><br>
          I'm a co-chair for this program. Here's what I do in this capacity:
          <br><br>
          I help manage the matching process for Big/Little Sisters, where
          freshmen women are assigned an upperclass mentor whom they can easily approach.
          As part of this, in Fall 2013, I have improved the process, so that everyone involved submits
          preferences which we compile into a cheat sheet. Then we hold an event where,
          with the aid of the cheat sheet, prospective big and little sisters can approach each other and conduct a
          meaningful conversation. We then take rankings and preferences from everyone involved and analyze them to make the matchings
          <br><br>

          I organize various social events both on and off campus where undergrad women
          can join in to do a fun activity while munching goodies and chatting with others
